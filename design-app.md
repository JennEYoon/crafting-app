# Designing.Cards.AI app  

Web-based app. Database is stored in the cloud. Can upload user's images, stampset images, card design images, card layout template, color scheme.  

Very much like SU MDS, but that was wayyy too expensive to use, also singe-user license on local PC. User's need to have graphics capabe computers, else too slow.  

Start very simple  
A4 card template in portrait and landscape.  
User upload stampset image, preferably with a ruler, but if known stampset, not necessary.  
User asks for card designs, auto-populated with standard layouts (template from favorite sites).  
Partial image has to be considered.  
Auto fit image into layout (uses actual stamp size)  
Mat and mount on coordinating colors.  
Auto fill inside stamp image with colors pre-selected (huristics).  
User can change colors by selecting each element.  

Color palettes pre-populated.  
User can create own color palette.  

Full image P/L  
2/3 image P/L  
1/3 image P/L  

3 squares L  
4 squares P  
Small circles  

Large square 3/4 size L/P  
Large circle L/P
Large oval L/P  
Other large shapes, butterfly diecut, heart diecut.  

Add accessorites, bows, edging cut.  
Add sentiment (standard sizes)  Can move placement of sentiment, shape of punch cutout for sentiment.  

Upload DSP paper photo, with ruler.  Design layouts using the paper.  

Show photos of similar design cards submitted by humans on splitcoast stampers. (May require AI)  
Need to classify each image layout, color scheme. Stampset used is identified, in database.  
Use blank registration image from Splitcoast Stampers?  
Scan catalogue images from SU and use for registration images, scan with ruler for size.  

I would really like this tool.  
Not competing with stamping companies, but allowing their products to be used more, easier for user's to design.
